# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This study guide was me building my very first webpage detailing notes and various things that I've learned along the way. I was motivated to do this because I wanted to start learning how to code and hopefully make a career out of it. It begun to solve the problem of unanswered questions like how a webpage is built and what goes on behind the scenes. I learned how to navigate through multiple different programs including HTML,CSS,Git, and Javascript. I also learned multiple commands to help me through those programs.
